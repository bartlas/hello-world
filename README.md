Hi World! 

Bartlas here!
I decided to create a GitHub account to learn how to use R and related stuff.
I am doing my master thesis in organic agricultre and I have been suggested to use R for organizing my data and creating a data base.
This is why I am here.
Today is my very first day and I am very excited about it!
I have been programming some years before in C++ in highschool but for some reason I didn't like it too much.
So I just dumped it and started learning agriculture. It seemed more logical since I was born on a farm in the countryside.
But now I realized how important technology is even in agriculture, especially in agricultural research.
Therefore, I am looking forward to learn R and make my research easier and more fun!
Good luck to myself and hope to read this in a few years when I will have much more experience.

Greetings,
Laci
